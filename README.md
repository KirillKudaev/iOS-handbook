This playbook consists of a set of guidelines that may be useful to you. It is a living document that contains good advice on how to style code, communicate, use git, and more. As a guideline, it is not a rule of law. Being consistent with the repo and your fellow developers takes precedence over this playbook. Also, the playbook can be ignored if a developer believes that adhering to the guidelines would give a worse result. At which point - you may want to consider updating the playbook ðŸ˜€

Don't forget to check out our favorite [suite of components and helper methods](http://github.com/usesweet) and the [other B&B iOS repos](https://github.com/bakkenbaeck?language=swift) to see if we've already built something to help with what you're trying to do.
